##Overview
Fire Survey is a survey system designed to capture custom made surveys with ability to edit and review responses after form submission.

##Installation
1. Clone the repository
1. Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`
1. Run `gulp` task to build up the sources
1. Point your http server to the `index.html` path

##Usage
Write up your form in *JSON* format and place it under `forms` directory.

All the forms of the system are generated by Angular-formly project. (url: [http://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/](http://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/)). Please refer to the project documentation for detailed overwiew of the specification.

 You can access the form under `/form/:FORM_FILE_NAME` route.

 Once submitted the url will be changed to the edit mode. URL will include unique submission identifier, which allows to review and edit the data.

##Configuration

    1. Configuration
        * **title** - where title for all forms is set
        * **text** - this is a placeholder for descriptive text which will be shown on the top of the surveys.
    1. FirebaseConfig
        * **url** - your [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) application endpoint
        * **forms** - document under which all the forms data will be stored

##Tips & Tricks
